# iOS Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Summary

The iOS deployment GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the error:

```
No profile for team 'GCRLV5UC4Q' matching 'Octo Vocab App Store' found: 
Xcode couldn't find any provisioning profiles matching 'GCRLV5UC4Q/Octo Vocab App Store'.
```

## Root Cause

The workflow was unable to access organization secrets and fastlane match was not properly downloading certificates and provisioning profiles from the shared repository.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Organization Secret Access

**Problem**: All organization secrets were empty in the workflow execution.

**Solution**: Added `secrets: inherit` to the `ios_deploy` job to enable access to organization secrets.

```yaml
ios_deploy:
  runs-on: macos-15
  timeout-minutes: 60
  secrets: inherit  # ‚úÖ Added this line
```

### 2. Added Team ID Configuration

**Problem**: Missing `FASTLANE_TEAM_ID` and `FASTLANE_ITC_TEAM_ID` secrets.

**Solution**: Hardcoded the known team ID (`GCRLV5UC4Q`) since it's fixed for the Apple Developer account.

```yaml
env:
  FASTLANE_TEAM_ID: "GCRLV5UC4Q"
  FASTLANE_ITC_TEAM_ID: "GCRLV5UC4Q"
```

### 3. Added Personal Access Token Support

**Problem**: Cannot access private match repository without authentication.

**Solution**: Added support for `MATCH_CERTS_PAT` secret for private repository access.

```ruby
# Fastfile - sync_certificates lane
if ENV["MATCH_CERTS_PAT"]
  git_url = ENV["MATCH_GIT_URL"].gsub('https://github.com/', "https://#{ENV["MATCH_CERTS_PAT"]}@github.com/")
end
```

### 4. Added Fastlane Match Integration

**Problem**: Certificates and provisioning profiles were not being downloaded before build.

**Solution**: Added explicit step to run `fastlane sync_certificates` before building.

```yaml
- name: üîê Sync certificates with Match
  working-directory: ios
  run: |
    fastlane sync_certificates
```

### 5. Simplified Build Configuration

**Problem**: Hardcoded certificate and provisioning profile UUIDs were causing conflicts.

**Solution**: Let match handle the provisioning profile selection automatically.

```ruby
# Removed hardcoded UUIDs, now uses:
export_options: {
  method: "app-store",
  teamID: ENV["FASTLANE_TEAM_ID"]
}
```

## Required Organization Secrets

Ensure these secrets are configured in your GitHub organization:

| Secret Name | Purpose | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| `MATCH_PASSWORD` | Encryption password for match certificates | `your-secure-password` |
| `MATCH_GIT_URL` | URL to shared certificates repository | `https://github.com/BLANXLAIT/blanxlait-ci-shared` |
| `MATCH_GIT_BRANCH` | Branch in certificates repository | `main` |
| `MATCH_CERTS_PAT` | Personal Access Token for private repo | `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID` | App Store Connect API Key ID | `ABC123DEF4` |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID` | App Store Connect Issuer ID | `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012` |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY` | Base64-encoded API key file | `LS0tLS1CRUdJTi...` |
| `FASTLANE_APPLE_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | App-specific password | `abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop` |

## Testing the Fix

You can test the deployment using manual workflow dispatch:

1. Go to **Actions** ‚Üí **iOS App Store Deployment**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select `deployment_target: beta`
4. Click **Run workflow**

## Expected Workflow Steps

The workflow should now:

1. ‚úÖ Access organization secrets successfully
2. ‚úÖ Validate all required secrets are available  
3. ‚úÖ Configure App Store Connect API authentication
4. ‚úÖ Download certificates and provisioning profiles via fastlane match
5. ‚úÖ Build the iOS app with proper code signing
6. ‚úÖ Upload to TestFlight

## Troubleshooting

If the workflow still fails:

1. **Check secret validation step**: Ensure all required secrets are available
2. **Check match authentication**: Verify `MATCH_CERTS_PAT` has access to the private repository
3. **Check certificates repository**: Ensure `blanxlait-ci-shared` contains valid certificates
4. **Check App Store Connect API**: Verify API key has proper permissions

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/ios-deploy.yml` - Added secret access and validation
- `ios/fastlane/Fastfile` - Updated match integration and build configuration  
- `ios/fastlane/Matchfile` - Made repository configuration dynamic
- `docs/ios-deployment-troubleshooting.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

After successful deployment, consider:

1. Setting up automated releases on version tags
2. Adding notification webhooks for deployment status
3. Implementing staged rollouts for production releases
