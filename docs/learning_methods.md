- Helps students learn from mistakes and reinforces correct usage.

## 5. Gamification
- Uses points, badges, streaks, and progress bars to motivate consistent practice.
- Makes learning engaging and rewarding.

## 6. Personalization
- Adapts difficulty and content based on student performance.
- Focuses practice on weaker vocabulary areas.

## 7. Progress Tracking
