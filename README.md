```

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing infrastructure:

```bash
# Full test suite with coverage and HTML reports
./scripts/test.sh all --coverage --html

# Unit tests only
./scripts/test.sh unit --coverage

# Widget tests only
./scripts/test.sh widget

# Quick test (development)
./scripts/test-quick.sh

# View coverage report
open coverage/html/index.html
```

**Current Test Coverage**: ~29% (focused on core study configuration system)

## 📱 App Store & Distribution

### Automated Screenshot Generation
The project includes automated screenshot generation for App Store submission:

```bash
# Generate screenshots for all supported devices
fastlane ios screenshots

# Upload screenshots to App Store Connect
fastlane ios upload_existing_screenshots
```

### Build & Release

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Test Suite

Octo Vocab includes a robust testing infrastructure with **26 automated tests** covering all aspects of functionality and privacy compliance:

| Test Type | Count | Coverage | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|----------|---------|
| **Unit Tests** | 14 | Privacy Compliance | COPPA, FERPA, GDPR verification |
| **Widget Tests** | 6 | UI Components | Privacy UI elements & dialogs |
| **Integration Tests** | 6 | End-to-End | Full app workflows & privacy flows |

### Privacy Compliance Testing

Our automated tests specifically verify:

- 🛡️ **COPPA Compliance** - No personal information collection from minors
- 🏫 **FERPA Compliance** - Educational records remain on-device only  
- 🇪🇺 **GDPR Compliance** - Right to data export and erasure
- 📱 **Offline-First** - No network requests during operation
- 🔒 **Data Security** - Local storage only, no external services

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
./scripts/test.sh all --coverage --html

# Run specific test suites
./scripts/test.sh unit              # Unit tests
./scripts/test.sh widget            # Widget tests  
./scripts/test.sh integration       # Integration tests
./scripts/test.sh privacy           # Privacy compliance tests

# View HTML coverage report
open coverage/html/index.html
```

### Continuous Integration

- ✅ **Automated Testing** - All PRs run full test suite
- 🔍 **Code Quality** - Formatting, analysis, and linting
