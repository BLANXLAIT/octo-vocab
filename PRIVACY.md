## Our Privacy Commitment

Octo Vocab is designed with privacy as our core principle. We believe learning should be private, secure, and completely under your control.

## What We Don't Collect

**We collect ZERO personal data.** Specifically:

- ❌ **No user accounts** - No registration, login, or user profiles
- ❌ **No personal information** - No names, emails, or contact details
- ❌ **No usage analytics** - No tracking of what you study or when

## How Your Data Stays Private

### Completely Offline
- All vocabulary content is stored locally on your device
- No internet connection required for any app functionality
- Your learning progress never leaves your device

### Local Storage Only
- Study progress and preferences are saved only to your device
- Data is stored using iOS's standard local storage (UserDefaults)
- No cloud sync or external data transmission

### No User Identification
- The app cannot identify individual users
- No persistent identifiers are created or stored
- Each app installation is completely anonymous

## Third-Party Services

**We use ZERO third-party services.** No:
- Analytics platforms (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
- Advertising networks
- Social media integrations
- Cloud storage services
- User behavior tracking tools

## Data Security

Since we don't collect any data, there's nothing to secure or breach. Your privacy is protected by:
- **Local-only storage** - Data never leaves your device
- **No network access** - App doesn't connect to the internet
- **iOS sandboxing** - Apple's built-in app isolation protects your data

## Children's Privacy (COPPA/FERPA Compliance)

Octo Vocab is designed for students aged 12-18 and is fully compliant with:
- **COPPA** (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)
- **FERPA** (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)

Since we collect no data whatsoever, there are no privacy concerns for minors.

## Educational Use

This app is designed for:
- Individual student use
- Classroom learning environments
- Homeschool settings
- Educational institutions

No special permissions or data handling procedures are needed for educational use.

## Changes to This Policy

Since our app design fundamentally prevents data collection, this privacy policy is unlikely to change. If we ever modify the app to collect any data (which would contradict our core mission), we will:
- Update this policy with clear explanations
- Notify users through app updates
- Maintain our commitment to user privacy
